## Creating Drivers

To get started creating a driver, first clone the [`driver-skeleton`](https://github.com/producttrap/driver-skeleton) repository.

Once this has been cloned, update any relevant details such as the package name, description, and namespace.

You can then rename the [`Skeleton`](https://github.com/producttrap/driver-skeleton/blob/main/src/Skeleton.php) and  [`SkeletonServiceProvider`](https://github.com/producttrap/driver-skeleton/blob/main/src/SkeletonServiceProvider.php) classes to the name of your driver.

Inside the `Skeleton` class, there are multiple methods, here is an overview of what each does:

- The public `__construct` method - this is where the class should be instantiated, and anything class properties derived from the configuration should be initialised.
- The public `find()` method - this should return an instance of the [`Product` DTO](https://github.com/producttrap/producttrap/blob/main/src/DTOs/Product.php), and is where the tracking details should be received from an API.
- The private `mapStatus()` and `getHeaders()` methods - these two methods are utility helper methods for mapping delivery values from the API to a [`Status` enum](https://github.com/producttrap/producttrap/blob/main/src/Enums/Status.php) instance, and for retrieving any relevant headers for the requests such as API `Authorization` headers.

Once the driver has been created, it's important to [add tests](https://github.com/producttrap/driver-skeleton/blob/main/tests/Feature/SkeletonTest.php), these can be mocked via a `MockHandler`, but should reflect the result of the actual API.

> **Note:** All custom exceptions should implement the `ProductTrap\Contracts\ProductTrapException` interface.

The driver can then be published to Packagist, make sure to use the [`producttrap-driver` keyword](https://github.com/producttrap/driver-skeleton/blob/main/composer.json#L6-L8) so that your driver can be discovered more easily.
